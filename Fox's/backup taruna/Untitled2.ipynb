But it is situated next to a fish restaurant and has its 'Airy' name must include the smell of fish and cooking seafood. Rooms 1, 2 and three without heaps of deodorant smell of fish. Room 24 has a great view and only has cooking smells. Don’t expect workable wifi, it needs an overhaul. I only found workable wifi twice late at night. The staff are friendly and helpful but they don’t have a solution for the wifi. It has a lovely court yard. Looks a tropical paradise. \n",
